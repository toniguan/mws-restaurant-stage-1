# Restaurant Reviews Project: Stage1
___
This project is part of Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree program. A barely usable restaurant review website is provided. I converted the static design to be responsive on different sized displays. Accessibility features are also added for screen reader user. I also use ServiceWorker technology to provide a seamless offline experience.


## How to run

1. download or clone the project from GitHub [project repository](https://github.com/toniguan/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git)
2. if you don't have Python, install it [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. in the site folder, run the following terminal cmd based on python version
   Python 2.x  : `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
   Python 3.x  : `pyton3 -m http.server 8000`
4. with your server running, visit the site `https://localhost:8000`


## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
